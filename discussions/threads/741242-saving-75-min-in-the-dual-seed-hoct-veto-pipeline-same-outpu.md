## Opening post

Hi everyone,

I've been working with the public **dual-seed UNet-transformer + DeepCenter + HOCT veto** pipeline (credit to the original authors and dataset owners, links below). While reading through a full run's logs I found a simple runtime saving that doesn't change the submission, and I think it matters more on the hidden test set than on the 4 public example videos.

## What I noticed

The notebook spends a lot of time before it writes the final submission:

| Stage | Time (2× T4) |
|---|---|
| Validator prediction on 8 held-out train videos | ~16 min |
| Scoring the base post-process config | ~7 min |
| Sweep of 7 post-process candidates | ~51 min |
| **Total before the final write** | **~75 min** |

The sweep only uses **train** videos, which are the same on every rerun. So it picks the same winner every time. In my runs that was:

```text
SELECTED: tight55  overrides={'MOTION_RELINK_TIGHT_UM': 5.5}
  base     proxy=0.9490 adj=0.9260 divJ=0.2308
  selected proxy=0.9511 adj=0.9280 divJ=0.2308
```

## The change

1. Set the selected value directly in the config cell:

```python
os.environ["BIOHUB_MOTION_RELINK_TIGHT_UM"] = "5.5"
```

2. Remove the validator prediction, the base scoring and the sweep cells.
3. Remove the first `write_test_submission("base")` call. That file gets overwritten later anyway. Write `submission.csv` **once**, with the HOCT veto armed.

Detection, linking, ILP, post-processing and HOCT mode stay exactly the same.

## Why it matters for the private LB

The HOCT veto has a wall-clock budget (`BIOHUB_HOCT_DEADLINE_H = 10`) and skips any video it predicts won't finish in time. On the public example set HOCT took ~18 min total, and the largest video (~70k nodes) alone took ~12 min. The hidden test set is about the size of the training set, so the veto can realistically hit the deadline. If it does, the remaining videos are written **without** the veto.

Freeing ~75 min gives HOCT that much more room, so fewer hidden-test videos should be skipped.

## Caveats

- Please diff `submission.csv` before and after on your own run. Small GPU nondeterminism can change a few rows.
- The local proxy uses only 8 videos, so treat small proxy differences with caution.

## Open questions

- Has anyone measured HOCT **mode 1 vs mode 2** on a held-out split? The notebook's validator never scores the veto itself.
- Division Jaccard on the local validator is low (3 TP / 1 FP / 9 FN). Has anyone found post-processing that improves divisions without hurting edge Jaccard?
