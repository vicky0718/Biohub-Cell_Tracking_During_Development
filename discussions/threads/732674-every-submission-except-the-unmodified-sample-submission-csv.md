## Opening post

I've been getting "Submission Scoring Error" on every real submission except the completely unmodified sample_submission.csv. To isolate the cause, I ran a series of diagnostic submissions — each one a throwaway notebook that just copies a pre-built CSV to submission.csv, so only the file content varies between tests. Results:

1) sample_submission.csv, unmodified — 20 rows, 1 track/dataset, 1 node/timepoint, constant coordinate (32,128,128) — SUCCESS, score 0.000
2) Synthetic, ~200 tracks/dataset, ~3% division rate — ~20,000 rows, many simultaneous tracks with branching, varied coordinates — Scoring Error
3) Synthetic, ~200 tracks/dataset, 0 divisions — ~18,800 rows, many simultaneous tracks, linear only, varied coordinates — Scoring Error
4) Synthetic, 15 tracks/dataset — 592 rows, many simultaneous tracks, varied coordinates — Scoring Error
5) Synthetic, single track/dataset, 90 nodes — ~360 rows, identical topology to #1 but scaled up, varied coordinates — Scoring Error
6) Synthetic, single track/dataset, 10 nodes, using the SAME constant coordinate as #1 — 76 rows, identical topology to #1, identical constant coordinate — Scoring Error
7) sample_submission.csv with ONE coordinate changed by 1 on a single node — 20 rows, identical to #1 except that one value — Scoring Error

Test #7 is the key result: it is byte-identical to the only successful submission except for a single digit in a single cell, and it still fails. This rules out row count, track topology, branching, and coordinate values/ranges as the cause — the only submission that has ever scored successfully is the literal, unmodified sample_submission.csv. Every submission format check I could think of (dtypes, monotonic ids, valid node/edge references, in-bounds coordinates, no orphan edges, matching dataset names, correct row_type conventions) came back clean on my real pipeline output as well.

This looks like it could be a bug in the scoring pipeline (e.g. comparing against a reference file rather than genuinely validating/scoring arbitrary submissions) rather than an issue with submission formatting on our end. Has anyone else run into this, or is there something about the submission format I'm missing? Happy to share the exact diagnostic CSVs if that's useful for reproducing it.

Update / correction: thanks to @bharat for pushing on this. I ran a few more diagnostics and the "any deviation from sample_submission.csv" framing in my original post is wrong. Here's what actually happened.

I built a submission that discovers the test dataset names dynamically at runtime (globbing /kaggle/input/**/test/*.zarr, no hardcoded names) and writes one node per dataset at t=0 with no edges at all. That's structurally very different from sample_submission.csv, yet it succeeded (score 0.000). I then extended it to a single track per dataset spanning t=0 through t=5 (6 nodes, 5 edges), same constant coordinate as before — that also succeeded.

But an earlier test with the same coordinate and topology extended to t=0 through t=9 (10 nodes, 9 edges) failed with Scoring Error. So the real trigger looks tied to the timepoint range, not "any change whatsoever" — the boundary is somewhere between t=5 (works) and t=9 (fails). My guess is submissions with t values beyond a dataset's actual frame count get rejected outright rather than just scored low, which would make sense if scoring validates node timepoints against the real video length per dataset.

One thing that doesn't fully fit yet: a submission that was byte-identical to sample_submission.csv except one coordinate changed by 1 (same small t range as the original) also failed. So there may be a second, separate validity check (e.g. coordinates needing to correspond to real detected structure) independent of the timepoint-range issue. Still narrowing this down — will update if I learn more. Appreciate the pointer to the getting-started kernel, it's what got me looking at this properly.

pre built csv won't work, the test folder is replaced by private samples during submission. The submission file is expected to have nodes, edges from all the given datasets in the private test folder. And the submission file should also have the id column.
